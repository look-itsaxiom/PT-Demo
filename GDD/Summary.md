# Project Township Game Design Document

## Core Concept

The game is a highly immersive RPG focused on **building, managing, and restoring a thriving town**. Players take on the role of both an adventurer and a guild leader, balancing personal questing and combat with the management of townspeople, resources, and town infrastructure. As players attract citizens (workers, artisans, and adventurers), they can assign them tasks, send them on missions, and leverage their skills to grow the town.

As the town develops, players unlock advanced gameplay features such as specialized jobs, rare gear, complex management options, and unique decision-making opportunities. The blend of personal involvement with the town’s growth and the player’s direct control over their avatar creates a rich, layered gameplay experience.

What I want to create is a game that feels like a polymerization of Fire Emblem, Rune Factory, Animal Crossing, Warcraft, and Pokemon. Taking the elements I find the most fun from each and placing them on a track I have seen work a la Final Fantasy Crystal Chonicles: My Life as a King but taken to the level of a full game rather than a WiiWare title.

## Unique Selling Points

* **In-Depth Character Customization:** A robust system allowing players to influence citizen growth and specialize their skills based on roles, gear, and affinities, fostering unique builds and strategic diversity.  
* **Deep Citizen Interaction:** Players know their citizens by name, track their stats and abilities, and influence their development, fostering personal connections with NPCs.  
* **Dynamic Progression:** The town evolves both visually and functionally as players build structures, attract new citizens, and unlock advanced capabilities.  
* **Balanced Dual Roles:** Players engage as both an adventurer, taking on quests and battles, and as a guild leader, managing the town’s growth and prosperity.

# Game Pillars

The core gameplay loop can be broken down into three interconnected pillars: RPG Elements, Exploration & Quests, and Town Building. Each pillar feeds into the others, creating a cycle of progression and engagement.

## RPG Elements

This pillar encompasses the core systems that define the RPG experience, including character stats, classes, jobs, races, abilities, equipment, and combat mechanics. These elements provide the foundation for player progression and strategic decision-making.

* **Character Stats**: These values determine a character's strengths and weaknesses in combat, crafting, and other activities.  
  * Endurance (END)  
  * Strength (STR)  
  * Defense (DEF)  
  * Intelligence (INT)  
  * Spirit (SPI)  
  * Magic Defense (MDF)  
  * Speed (SPD)  
  * Luck (LCK)  
  * Accuracy (ACC)  
* **Character Races**: Each race has unique traits and base stat ranges, offering different playstyles and strategic advantages.  
  * Gignen  
  * Fae  
  * Stoneheart  
  * Beastkin  
  * Kithan  
  * Angarkin  
  * Demarkin  
  * Reptilekin  
* **Character Classes & Jobs**: Adventurers can specialize in various classes, while citizens can take on jobs that contribute to the town's growth.  
  * Adventurer Classes (Warrior, Magician, Scout, and their advanced specializations)  
  * Citizen Jobs (Farmer, Blacksmith, Artisan, Merchant, Scholar, and specialized roles)  
* **Growth Rates**: Characters are generated with inherent predispositions to each individual stat. This greatly affects that stat’s growth over time and is important in deciding a character’s given class or job.  
* **Character Abilities**: Both active and passive abilities enhance combat and other activities, offering strategic depth and customization.  
* **Attribute System**: The core attributes (Fire, Wind, Water, Earth, Dark, Light, and Physical) and their relationships play a crucial role in combat and character development.  
* **Equipment and Gear**: Weapons, armor, and other items can be equipped to improve character stats and abilities.  
* **Combat System**: The turn-based combat system emphasizes strategic decision-making, elemental interactions, and party composition.

## Exploration & Quests

This pillar focuses on the player's adventures outside the town, including exploration, resource gathering, and questing. These activities provide the resources and experience needed to fuel town growth and character progression.

* **Player vs. NPC Adventuring**: Players can either embark on quests themselves or send NPC adventurers to complete them autonomously.  
* **Quest Types**: Various quest types offer different challenges and rewards.  
  * Main Story Quests  
  * Exploration Quests  
  * Resource Gathering Quests  
  * Item Retrieval Quests  
  * Combat Missions  
  * Training Quests  
* **Quest Rewards**: Successful quests yield gold, resources, gear, and experience points, contributing to both character and town development.  
* **Monster Design and Stat Scaling**: Monsters pose a dynamic challenge through a stat scaling system that adapts to the player's progress.

## Town Building

This pillar revolves around the development and management of the town itself. Players use resources gathered through exploration and quests to construct buildings, attract new citizens, and unlock advanced features. The town's growth directly impacts the RPG elements, enabling access to new classes, jobs, and equipment.

* **Buildings and Structures**: Key building types include housing, production facilities, and specialized structures.  
* **Town Development and Progression**: The town evolves visually and mechanically as players expand its borders and upgrade its buildings.  
* **Renown and External Influence**: The town's renown increases as it grows, attracting higher-quality citizens and new challenges.  
* **Citizen Interaction**: Players can interact with citizens to increase morale and potentially engage in romantic relationships.

# Narrative and Worldbuilding

## Backstory and Setting

The narrative and worldbuilding are under active development. The focus is on creating a unique, cohesive setting that enhances gameplay and immersion. Key elements include:

* **Player Role**: Players act as both adventurers and guild leaders, tasked with restoring a small settlement to prominence in a fantastical, yet grounded world.  
* **Thematic Focus**: Themes of rebuilding, community, and exploration drive the narrative.

The kingdom has become increasingly unstable due to a rise in coordinated monster activity. Small settlements have been abandoned and citizens displaced. You are a newly appointed Guild Master, sent to a forgotten borderland village (named by the player at the start of the game) to reestablish a foothold and build an Adventuring Guild capable of restoring order and stability to the region.

The narrative unfolds in the background as the player builds structures, completes quests, and attracts citizens. It exists purely to support mechanical progression and milestone-based unlocking of gameplay systems.

## Narrative Progression Framework

This narrative structure is designed to provide a lightweight but effective story arc that supports and contextualizes core game mechanics, particularly town development, exploration, and adventurer progression. It avoids scope creep and unnecessary complexity while reinforcing the player’s sense of purpose.

## Antagonist and Conflict

The specific antagonist and overarching conflict remain works in progress. This section will evolve as the overall narrative direction is finalized, ensuring cohesion with the gameplay and thematic goals.

# Aesthetic and Style

## Visual Theme and Style

* Primary: Low Poly, Gamecube, late N64 (Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Kirby64) inspired graphics with deep customization and randomization options.  
* Bright, Colorful, beyond what those systems were probably capable of while still replicating their look and feel while ditching the difficulties in their limitations.

## Tone and Atmosphere

Lighthearted and fun, with occasional moments of seriousness to enhance depth.

## Sound and Music

Relaxing, immersive soundscapes for town life. Dynamic music for battles and high-tension moments.

# Development Scope

## Target Platform

Steam, with stretch goals for consoles and Steam Deck compatibility.

## Development Team

Currently solo, with plans for potential outsourcing as needed.

## Game Length and Features

* Core gameplay: 10-15 hours.  
* Endgame: Endless dungeon progression, potential multiplayer elements.

## Timeframe and Budget

* MVP by 2025, supported by a $200/month budget.
