# Project Township: Project Management Log

## Current Goals & Milestones
- [ ] Scaffold Exploration pillar: location definition, travel system, encounter system, and exploration quest type (pm, prod)

## Active Tasks
- [ ] Define "location" data structure and properties (pm, dev, prod)
  - Assigned to: prod (design requirements), boss (technical requirements)
  - Progress: Design definition for locations and room structure completed and documented in GDD/GamePillarDetails.md (2025-05-08)
  - Progress: RoomType classes scaffolded as [GlobalClass]es, AssociatedLocation property removed to prevent circular references (2025-05-09)
- [ ] Implement player travel system that consumes in-game time (pm, dev, prod)
- [ ] Scaffold encounter system that triggers events based on location (pm, dev, prod)
- [ ] Create quest type for exploring locations (pm, dev, prod)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Bootstrap project management and daily standup workflow (pm) (2025-05-08)
- [x] Break down current features into nucular tasks (pm) (2025-05-08)

## [2025-05-08] GDD Markdown Readability Improvements
- Standardized all stat range dashes to a single hyphen-minus '-' for consistency and human readability in GDD/GamePillarDetails.md.
- Converted all formulas in the Stat Calculation System and Core Stat Formulas sections to fenced code blocks for improved markdown preview.
- These changes improve clarity and preview display for all team members and future contributors.

## [2025-05-09] Exploration Pillar Implementation Progress
- RoomType classes scaffolded as [GlobalClass]es in Scripts/Exploration/LocationRooms/.
- AssociatedLocation property removed from all RoomType classes and LocationRoomSkeleton to prevent circular reference errors in Godot.
- Documentation and codebase are now aligned on this structure. See dev and doc standup for details.

## Standup Ritual Expectations

The daily standup is a brief, structured check-in to align on project progress, priorities, and blockers. It ensures clarity, momentum, and accountability for each development session.

**Standup logs are now tracked in [docs/StandupLog.md](StandupLog.md).**

### Inputs
- Summary of what was accomplished in the previous session (from pm/dev/prod/doc as relevant)
- Current state of active tasks (from docs/Project.md)
- Any new blockers, questions, or design clarifications needed
- Updated priorities or focus areas from the prompter

### Ritual Steps
1. pm summarizes what was completed last session and current project status
2. pm/dev/prod/doc report on their respective areas if relevant
3. The prompter (boss) clarifies today’s focus, priorities, or any blockers
4. pm updates docs/Project.md with:
   - Standup log (date, summary, today’s focus, blockers)
   - Any changes to active/completed tasks
5. Confirm next actionable nucular tasks for the session

### Outputs
- Updated standup log in docs/Project.md
- Clear, actionable list of tasks for the session
- Identification of any blockers or design clarifications needed
- Alignment on next milestone or focus area
