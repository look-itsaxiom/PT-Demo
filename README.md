# Project Township Demo

Welcome to **Project Township Demo**, a Godot project for a game I'm developing in my spare time. Game design has always been a passion of mine, and creating my own game has been a lifelong dream. This project is a step toward making that dream a reality.

## About Me

Game design has always been more than just a hobby for me—it's a passion. I've spent countless hours learning, experimenting, and dreaming about creating my own game. This project is my way of bringing those dreams to life, and I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I’ve enjoyed creating it.

Thank you for checking out **Project Township Demo**!
